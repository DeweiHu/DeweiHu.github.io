### Summary
The auther propose two constrains in addition to the episodic training strategy leveraged in meta-learning approaches.

(a) The overview of the proposed method. L<sub>task</sub> indicate the specific loss function w.r.t the task. (e.g. the cross entropy loss for classification problem). The L<sub>global</sub> is delineating the difference of class-correlations between training data (D<sub>tr</sub>) and test data (D<sub>te</sub>). The L<sub>local</sub> is a contrastive loss that serves to minimize the within class samples and maximize the cross class samples.<br \>
<br />
(b) D<sub>i</sub> and D<sub>j</sub> indicate the training dataset and testing dataset. To represent the general feature of a certain class, we compute the mean feature z<sub>c</sub>. Then the relationship(correlation) between different classes depicted by a confusion matrix. To enhance the generalizability of the model, the assumption is such correlation should be consistent independent from the input data distribution. Hence the confusion matrix generated from D<sub>i</sub> and D<sub>j</sub> should follow the same distribution. The objective is then proposed in a form of symmetric KL divergence:

(c) The mechanism of local loss function is the same with the contrastive loss, minimizing the feature distance between the same class while maximizing the distance between samples of different classes. Instead of directly using the feature z, the author implement an additional embedding network M, the distance is expressed by the following:
